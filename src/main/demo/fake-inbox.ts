We're integrating with your API and running into rate limiting issues. Currently seeing 429 errors when we try to make more than 100 requests per minute.

1. Is there a way to increase our rate limit for production use?
2. Should we implement exponential backoff, or is there a webhook alternative?
3. Do you have any batch endpoints we could use instead?

We're planning to go live next week, so any guidance would be super helpful!

- Authentication approach

I'll share a doc before the meeting so we can hit the ground running.

See you Monday!`,

  "demo-004": `Hey Gustaf,

Happy to help! Here are answers to your questions:

1. **Rate limit increase**: You can request a higher limit through our developer portal at developers.example.com/rate-limits. For production use cases, we typically approve 1000 req/min.

2. **Backoff strategy**: Yes, exponential backoff is recommended. Start with 1 second delay, double each retry, max 5 retries.

3. **Batch endpoints**: Check out POST /v2/batch - it handles up to 100 operations per request and doesn't count against your rate limit the same way.

Let me know if you need anything else before your launch!`,

    body: `Dear Dr. Ralston,

Thank you for sharing the preliminary analysis. I have reviewed the documentation thoroughly and would like to offer the following observations:

1. The projected growth figures for Q4 appear well-substantiated by the market data presented
2. I would recommend we revisit the risk mitigation strategy outlined in Section 3, particularly regarding currency exposure
3. The timeline for implementation seems achievable, though I suggest we build in additional review cycles

I would be happy to schedule a meeting at your earliest convenience to discuss these points in greater detail.

Best regards`,

    body: `Dear Geoff,

Thank you for circulating the proposed agenda for the upcoming board meeting. I have reviewed each item carefully and have the following recommendations:

1. I believe the technology roadmap presentation should be moved earlier in the agenda, as it provides context for the budget discussion
2. The compliance update section could benefit from a brief overview of recent regulatory developments
3. I would suggest allocating an additional fifteen minutes to the strategic partnerships discussion

Please let me know if you would like to discuss any of these suggestions before finalizing the agenda.

    body: `Dear Dr. Ralston,

I appreciate you sharing the due diligence findings. After a thorough review of the materials, I would like to highlight several areas that warrant further examination:

1. The intellectual property portfolio appears strong, though I recommend independent verification of the three pending patents
2. The financial projections in the management presentation appear optimistic relative to industry benchmarks
3. The customer concentration risk should be carefully evaluated, as the top three clients represent over sixty percent of revenue

I am available to discuss these findings at your convenience. I would also recommend we engage external counsel to review the IP matters prior to proceeding.

    body: `Dear Geoff,

Thank you for the productive discussion regarding the partnership framework. I wanted to follow up with a summary of the key points we agreed upon:

1. The governance structure will follow a joint committee model with equal representation
2. Financial commitments will be reviewed on a quarterly basis with defined escalation procedures
3. Intellectual property developed during the partnership will be jointly owned, subject to pre-existing IP carve-outs

I will have my team prepare a detailed term sheet reflecting these principles for your review by end of week.

Thank you for initiating the annual compliance review process. I have completed my assessment of the areas under my purview and would like to report the following:

1. All mandatory training requirements have been fulfilled across the team
2. Data handling procedures have been updated to reflect the latest regulatory guidance
3. I have identified two areas where our current policies would benefit from revision, which I have detailed in the attached memorandum

I am confident that we remain in full compliance with all applicable regulations. Please do not hesitate to contact me should you require any additional information.

I have reviewed the investment committee briefing materials and prepared my analysis of the three proposed opportunities:

1. The Series B opportunity in the enterprise software space presents an attractive risk-adjusted return profile
2. The infrastructure fund allocation merits further discussion, particularly regarding the illiquidity premium assumptions
3. I recommend we defer consideration of the emerging markets vehicle until we have completed our geographic exposure analysis

I will be prepared to present these findings at Thursday's committee meeting.

Thank you for sharing the proposed governance policy updates. I have reviewed the revisions carefully and offer the following feedback:

1. The enhanced disclosure requirements are well-aligned with current best practices
2. I would suggest strengthening the conflict of interest provisions in Section 4.2
3. The board composition guidelines should reference the diversity commitments we made in our annual report

These are otherwise comprehensive and well-drafted revisions. I am supportive of their adoption at the next board meeting.

I have completed my review of the risk assessment findings and concur with the overall conclusions. I would like to add the following observations:

1. The operational risk category should incorporate scenarios related to supply chain disruption
2. The cybersecurity risk rating may need to be elevated given recent industry developments
3. I recommend we establish a quarterly risk review cadence to ensure our assessments remain current

I am available to discuss these observations at your earliest convenience and can provide supporting documentation as needed.

    body: `Dear Geoff,

I have reviewed the strategic advisory engagement proposal with great interest. The scope of work is well-defined and the proposed methodology is sound. I would like to offer several suggestions:

1. The discovery phase would benefit from inclusion of key operational stakeholders in addition to the executive team
2. I recommend incorporating a competitive landscape analysis as a distinct workstream
3. The proposed fee structure is reasonable and consistent with market benchmarks for engagements of this nature

I am supportive of proceeding and would be pleased to serve on the steering committee as proposed.
